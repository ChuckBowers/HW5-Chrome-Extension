# HW5-Chrome-Extension

Name: Bookmark Manager

Author: Will Bowers

Description: This is a Chrome Extension that allows users to create bookmarks 
             independent of the Chrome Bookmarks. 'Show Bookmarks' shows all the
             bookmarks saved for that user. 'Add Current Tab' adds the current
             tab as a bookmark. 'Search' allows the user to search the bookmark
             titles via a given string. 'Delete All' deletes all the bookmarks
             saved in the Extension.

Installation Instructions: To install, navigate to the Extensions part of Chrome,
                           and switch to developer mode. Then select "LOAD UNPACKED"
                           and find this directory in your file system. Then select
                           the directory "dist" in this directory and click "Ok".
                           Then you should refresh the page and be good to go!

Developer's Notes: There is still an issue with clicking the bookmarks saved in the 
                   Bookmark Manager. Instead of being able to left click and have
                   the page open in a new tab, you have to right click and select 
                   "Open link in new tab". Unfortunately I was not able to figure this out before the deadline for this assignment.
